# Our sample app:

It's a simple note-taking app with the following features:

* Login.
* View list of notes.
* Create new note.
* Update existing note.
* Delete a note.

Here's a gif that runs through all functionalities of the app:

However, our job today is not about how to build such app. What we're gonna do instead is learning how to write automated UI tests for it. That's the exciting part.

# But what does automated UI tests look like anyway?

Let's have a look at this video:

<iframe width="840" height="472" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HEGl3Lj4SLE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As soon as the test suite is launched, it simulates all kinds of user interactions:

* filling in a text field.
* tapping a button.
* swiping around.

It travels through each screen and test all scenarios in sequence:

* at Login screen, it tests scenario when:
  * entering correct username and password.
  * password field is empty.
  * username field is empty.
  * entering incorrect username or password.
* at Note screen, it tests scenario when:
  * adding a new note.
  * deleting notes.
  * editting an existing note.

**It looks funny**.

Firing up the UI tests and watch it flies through everything is a fun experience.

So the next time someone asks you to show the app, just run the UI tests. He'll be amazed and impressed at the same time. ðŸ˜œ

# Why should we write automated UI tests?

There are some key benefits here:

* **Avoid regression bugs and minimize time spent on manual testing**:

  Actually this is the benefit of automated tests in general.

  When you make some changes in the code, the tests are there to make sure that you don't break anything (regression). And that your app still works as expected.

  If there is no tests, it's dangerous to even make a slightest change. One has to be very careful and do a lot of manual testing to gain back his confidence.

  If there is no tests, we will need the whole QC team to sit together trying to break the app and looking for bugs. Now we don't anymore. UI tests will take care of that pretty nicely.

  I'm not saying that we should totally rely on automated tests. There is always something that tests can't cover. We still need to test the app manually ourselves. However, the time we spend on it is kept to a minimum.

* **Helps test view controllers**:

  Given the design of UIKit framework where everything is tightly coupled (the window, the view, the controller, the app lifecycle), that makes it very hard to write unit tests for view controllers even for the simplest scenario.

  It's still possible but we would have to mock and stub things around, simulate events and stuffs, which turns out to be a ton of work and doesn't prove useful at all.

  Why fight the system when we can ride with it?

  UI test puts us in the role of a user. A user doesn't care about any logic underneath. All he wants to do is tapping buttons and expect to see something appear on the screen. That's it.

* **Helps to document your code**:

  Look at this:

{% highlight swift %}
func testLoginWithWrongCredentials() {
  fillInWrongUsername()
  fillInWrongPassword()
  tapButton("Login")
  expectToSeeAlert("Username or password is incorrect")
  tapButton("OK")
}
{% endhighlight %}

  This is a UI test for the scenario when user tries to login with the wrong credentials.

  Actually you don't need me to tell you what it is. It's obvious.

  If you organize your tests mindfully, you'll get this same effect. People will understand what the app can do just by reading the tests. It's the best documentation.

* **Provides a visual run-through of your app**:

  As I mentioned earlier, this is simply fun.

  It's a nice thing to have and you're gonna love it.

Alright! I hope that gets you a little bit more excited about UI testings. Let's dive deeper.

# Understand UI testing:

To write UI tests, we're gonna need a framework called [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF), an excellent testing tool for iOS developers.

## Accessibility Label:

### How to set it?

1. From code:

2. From Storyboard:

### How to inspect it?

# How to setup UI testing?

## Step 1: Import KIF and Nimble using cocoapods

Add `pod 'KIF'` and `pod 'Nimble'` to your *Podfile*. Remember to put them in the test target instead.

{% highlight ruby %}
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'SimpleNoteTakingApp' do
  use_frameworks!

  #...

  target 'SimpleNoteTakingAppTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
    pod 'KIF'
    pod 'Nimble'
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

Open Terminal and run:

{% highlight sh %}
pod install
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 2: Create KIF helper for Swift

Create a *KIF+Extensions.swift* file in your test target.

{% highlight swift %}
import KIF

extension XCTestCase {
  func tester(file : String = #file, _ line : Int = #line) -> KIFUITestActor {
    return KIFUITestActor(inFile: file, atLine: line, delegate: self)
  }

  func system(file : String = #file, _ line : Int = #line) -> KIFSystemTestActor {
    return KIFSystemTestActor(inFile: file, atLine: line, delegate: self)
  }
}

extension KIFTestActor {
  func tester(file : String = #file, _ line : Int = #line) -> KIFUITestActor {
    return KIFUITestActor(inFile: file, atLine: line, delegate: self)
  }

  func system(file : String = #file, _ line : Int = #line) -> KIFSystemTestActor {
    return KIFSystemTestActor(inFile: file, atLine: line, delegate: self)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Create a briding header:

* Create a new temporary Objective-C file in your test target. You can name it to anything.

![](/images/how-to-setup-testing-for-new-ios-project/create-objc-file.png)

* Xcode will ask whether you also want to add a briding header. Hit **Create Bridging Header**.

![](/images/how-to-setup-testing-for-new-ios-project/add-bridging-header.png)

* Delete the temporary ObjC file we just created above. We don't need it anymore.

Import **KIF** from within the bridging header (*SimpleNoteTakingApp-Bridging-Header.h*).

{% highlight objc %}
#import <KIF/KIF.h>
{% endhighlight %}

Create our first UI test (also in the test target). Let's name it *LoginTests.swift*.

{% highlight swift %}
import KIF

class LoginTests : KIFTestCase {

  func testSomethingHere() {
    tester().tapViewWithAccessibilityLabel("hello")
  }

}
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that:

* your UI test must subclass from **KIFTestCase**.
* test methods must begin with the word **test**. For example: testA, testB, testLogin, testSomethingElse, ect...

Now let's run the test to see how it works (Cmd + U).

It should open up the iOS simulator and stop at the login screen. Wait for a couple of seconds. Then fail.

That's because we haven't had any view with accessibility label of **hello** yet. We're gonna fix that later. But for now, we have our first UI test up and running. It's cool.

# How to organize your UI tests?

# Let's start writing UI tests for our elegent note-taking app

## Step 3: Test the first screen

## Step 4: Move step definitions out into extension

## Step 5: Test the second screen

## Step 6: Move common steps into base class

# Some common scenarios you may encounter:

## Inspect properties of a control:

## Working with TabBar:

## Swiping around:

## Dealing with alert and action sheet:

## Pull to refresh:

## Working with textfields:

## Working with UITableView and UICollectionView:

## Wait for sometime:

## Working with photos and gallery:

## Dealing with network requests:

## Dealing with permissions:

# Wrap up
