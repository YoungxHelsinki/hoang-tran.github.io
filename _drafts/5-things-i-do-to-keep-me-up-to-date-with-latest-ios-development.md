Every year, millions of people focus their attention on one of the biggest developer event in the world: the **WWDC**.

This is the place where Apple share their brand new APIs and technologies in various aspects of iOS development.

Many APIs are so good that they deprecate the old ones.

Many techniques are so great that we can't imagine living without it.

iOS developers from around the world leave the event feeling inspired. They start experimenting with new stuffs. They talk about it. They blog about it.

Everyday there are thousands of projects being built and shared across all mediums.

It's hard to keep up with all of these information if we don't invest the time and effort to actually learn it.

Today I will share 5 things I do that helps me stay up-to-date.

# 1. Watch WWDC videos:

Technically, WWDC presentations are very deep. There usually is a live coding session to showcase what the new API can do and how to implement it in various scenarios.

Each video is around 20-60 minutes so it's best if you can allocate the time at night or weekends to watch it.

All videos can be found here: <https://developer.apple.com/videos>

Note: Make sure to open the video in **Safari** instead of *Chrome* or *Firefox*. Apple video streaming only works in Safari.
