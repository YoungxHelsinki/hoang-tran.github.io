Every year, millions of people focus their attention on one of the biggest developer event in the world: the **WWDC**.

This is the place where Apple share their brand new APIs and technologies in various aspects of iOS development.

Many APIs are so good that they deprecate the old ones.

Many techniques are so great that we can't imagine living without it.

iOS developers from around the world leave the event feeling inspired. They start experimenting with new stuffs. They talk about it. They blog about it.

Everyday there are thousands of projects being built and shared across all mediums.

It's hard to keep up with all of these information if we don't invest the time and effort to actually learn it.

Today I will share 5 things I do that helps me stay up-to-date.

# 1. Watch WWDC videos:

Technically, WWDC presentations are very deep. There usually is a live coding session to showcase what the new API can do and how to implement it in various scenarios.

Each video is around 20-60 minutes so it's best if you can allocate the time at night or weekends to watch it.

All videos can be found here: <https://developer.apple.com/videos>

Note: Make sure to open the video in **Safari** instead of *Chrome* or *Firefox*. Apple video streaming only works in Safari.

# 2. Read blog:

Many of the great things I learnt over the years are mostly from reading blog posts. By spending a couple of minutes on a post, you know:

* What other developers are building. What their challenge is. And how they solved it.
* What programming ideas get shared the most. Are they good? Why? Can you apply to your own project?
* Or simply just to understand how to do things properly.

There's always something you don't know. Keep an open mind and you'll learn alot.

# 3. Use Twitter:

When I first joined Twitter, none of my friends were there.

Sometimes I find a few familiar faces but rarely do I see them posting any tweets at all.

Then I left.

It took me a long time to realize that I've been using Twitter the wrong way. And that Twitter is not like Facebook in any sense.

## So what do we use Twitter for?

# 4. Use GitHub:

## Look for what's trendings on Objective-C and Swift

## Follow people on GitHub

# 5 Experiment on my own:
